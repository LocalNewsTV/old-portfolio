const aboutMe = {
    aboutIntro: `My name is Matthew and in the past I was a chef of 8 years with red seal certification.<br> 
    Under the tutelage of my chef Aaron, I gained tremendous organizational, cooperative, and multitasking skills. Chef Aaron was heavily influential in my upbringing both as a cook, and as a person.<br>
    Nowadays I am an ICS student at Camosun College, carrying with me all my past lessons and continuing to push my growth.`,
    
    aboutImmersion: `Thanks to my father, I've been fortunate enough to have been using computers in my daily life since the age of three. For as long as I can remember, I can recall being carted off to breakfast at 8:00AM on Sundays for breakfast, while my father and his friends would talk for hours about recent tech, software (particularly Antivirus and vulnerabilities). Now as I've grown up, I've used them for entertainment through games, to educate myself on topics both big and small, as well as to connect with people across the globe. I'm both happy and humbled to be able to educate myself now on what made all of these past experiences possible, and the effort/resources required to run the web as we know it today.<br><br>
    My transition from Culinary Arts shifted during the Covid-19 pandemic, when during the shutdowns my partner guided me towards doing some online Software Development tutorials. After the brief exposure to what is behind the curtain, I immediately sought enrollment to earn my diploma.`,
    
    aboutHobbies: `I divide my spare time between exploring what the Pacific North West has to offer, creating small web application with JavaScript, and diving deep into artifical worlds through manga, novels and video games. I am a big fan of games by YokoTaro, as well as Team Cherry. I absolutely enjoy getting into coffee brewing through pourover methods, and continuing to grow my culinary art skills from the comfort of home.`,

    aboutMuse: `In the end, this entire portfolio is a love letter to my partner. Without her I never would've taken the plunge to enter this industry. She pushed me out of my comfort zone and challenged me to be here, without her this wouldn't have been possible. Thank you Angela, and thank you, to you that's here reading.`,
